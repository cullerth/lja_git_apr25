[Library Juice Academy - Git & GitHub for Libraries](https://libraryjuiceacademy.com/shop/course/268-git-and-github-for-libraries/)

This course introduces the basic concepts and skills for using Git and GitHub, a popular version control system and platform, in a library setting. Git and GitHub are often used to manage open source software, library technology, and academic research projects. Individuals and teams use Git to record changes within a projectâ€™s source code and GitHub to share and publish their work online. Library staff are using these technologies to support work in a variety of contexts, including metadata, data analysis, digital humanities, open educational resources, archives, and open science. While this course focuses on the fundamentals of Git and GitHub, students will pick up some basic command-line and plain-text editing skills along the way.

Throughout the course, students will:
- Examine use cases for Git and GitHub as tools for library technology projects
- Use Git from the command-line to manage versions of a digital project
- Collaborate with peers on Git repositories hosted on the GitHub platform
- Consider how libraries can support the use of Git and GitHub for research and education
- Test advanced GitHub features for project management, automation, and web publishing
